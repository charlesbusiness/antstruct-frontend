# ERP Frontend (React + MUI)

A **modular React frontend** for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.  
Carefully built with **Material UI (MUI)**, **React Hooks**, and **Context API** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clean user experience.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Is Relevant

This project demonstrates modern frontend engineering practices for enterprise-scale applications:

- **UI/UX Development** – Built with Material UI for consistent, responsive design.  
- **State Management** – Leveraging React Hooks and Context API for clean and predictable state handling.  
- **Modularity** – Component-driven architecture that can be extended across business domains.  
- **Integration Ready** – Designed to consume RESTful APIs from the ERP backend (Laravel + MySQL + Docker).  
- **Scalability** – Reusable components and context-driven data flows make it suitable for large enterprise systems.  

---

## 🚀 Features

### Core Modules (Frontend Views)
- **Projects** – Project dashboards, task lists, and progress tracking  
- **HR Module** – Employee management, attendance, payroll views  
- **Employee Module** – Profiles, roles, and access management UI  
- **Inventory Module** – Stock levels, supplier management, warehouse UI  
- **Activity Module** – Activity feeds, logs, and business workflows  
- **Marketing Module** – Campaign dashboards, lead tracking, and client interactions  

### General Features
- Material UI design system for consistency  
- Global state with Context API  
- Protected routes & authentication flows  
- Responsive layouts (mobile + desktop)  
- API service layer for backend communication  
- Modular and extensible component structure
